## General

It is preferred to use the `Bcc` field for sending email to participants - that we way we protect their privacy by not displaying their email address to all recipients.

## Initial Preparation

FIXME find dates and book room with the Science Library

FIXME generating the workshop website at https://github.com/uio-carpentry using template from https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template


## A Week Before

FIXME send pre-workshop assessment form link

## After the workshop

* download the registration information from `nettskjema.uio.no`, add one column for each workshop day and add an `x` for those participants that were present
* send Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry admin the number of attendants for both days

FIXME find a way to centrally, but safely, collect this information

* obtain the post-workshop assessment form link from the workshop uio-carpentry.github.io pages, or from SWC/DC admin
* download the workshop etherpad in text format; take out any information that should not be sent around
* for all those that participated on at least one of the days
  * add their email addresses to the [discussions@swcarpentry.uio.no list](https://sympa.uio.no/swcarpentry.uio.no/review/discussions) and the [announcements@swcarpentry.uio.no list](https://sympa.uio.no/swcarpentry.uio.no/review/announcements) lists (ask for admin privileges if you cannot add people)
  * send them an email, see the [template](post_workshop_email_template.md)

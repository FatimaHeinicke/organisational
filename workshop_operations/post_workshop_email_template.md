- we have added you (or will do this soon) to two mailing lists: Announcements (for new workshops) and  Discussions (anything you'd like to ask related to the workshops and materials taught). Emails from these lists contain unsubscribe links should you wish to do so
- get Involved! the 'Carpentry' effort at UiO is a volunteer project; if you'd like to help us, let us know by sending an email to contact-us@swcarpentry.uio.no

FIXME once it is up, add the link to the to-be-made Carpentry@UiO website

Hoping to see you again on another occasion, on behalf of the workshop instructors and helpers,

**Learner 1:**

Thanks to everyone involved in making the Software Carpentry Workshops happen. 
They have been such an inspiration for me, and a truly powerful tool for learning how to program. 
Git, Shell, loops and code is something that has never been a part of my curriculum, 
but that I use every day as a struggling science-noob. 
Looking forward to many more (FREE!!) workshops, and will recommend you to the entire
department if I can.

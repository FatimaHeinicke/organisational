##Adoption of Agenda##

The agenda was adopted. 

##Summary 2015##


###General###

The Science Library has been very helpful and helped us to run UIO Software Carpentry Workshops in 2015 (helped for the registration process, to find a room, they also handled surveys, ordered coffee/snacks). 

The University of Oslo is not a member of the Software Carpentry foundation. As a consequence the University of Oslo does not have any priority on the Software Carpentry Instructor program which makes it difficult to get new instructors.

USIT would be the most natural organization to become member of the Software Carpentry Foundation but they are not interested.

To find another possible host for this membership, Arnstein has discussed with Knut Mørken (Computing in Science Education, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences) who showed a great interest in Software Carpentry activities; further discussions will take place to possibly include Software Carpentry lessons for bachelors. Software Carpentry may be invited for the Seminar they organized in February on reforming bachelor programs. 

This is clearly an opportunity for UIO to become member of the Software Carpentry Foundation. Lex mentioned that going through the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences may trigger problems as it does not cover all disciplines. We strongly agreed with him and insisted on the fact that Software Carpentry workshops should be run for all disciplines covered at UIO.


###Workshops in 2015###

Hugues was not present and could not summarized the 2015 Software Carpentry Surveys. However, Lex & Karin gave a short summary:

    - UIO held 3 workshops in 2015. 
    - All of them were a combination of shell, git and python. 
    - 101 persons registered to these workshops and 70 persons attended.


###Email lists###

Several Email lists were opened and are now fully operational:

- announcements@swcarpentry.uio.no
- discussions@swcarpentry.uio.no
- organizers@swcarpentry.uio.no

Ben mentioned he sent an email to this list but nobody received it. Karin replied that he sent it before the lists were up and running.

###Actions###
- Lex, Karin and Arnstein will continue their effort to find a suitable host at UIO to become member of the Software Carpentry Foundation and they will inform us as soon as a solution is found.
- Hugues will send the survey summary to Lex (to be incorporated in the report in preparation).
- Ben will resent the email (podcast on Software & Data Carpentry goals) to the list

## Workshops in 2016##
We plan to organize about 7 Software Carpentry workshops in 2016 as well as a Carpentry Week (March 2016)

    - February
    - March (Carpentry week, see own item)
    - April
    - May/June
    - September
    - October
    - November
    - early December

###General organization of Software Carpentry Workshop###
The organization procedures were discussed and in general were found satisfying. As last year, we agreed to give priority to those who are in the waiting list for the registration. 

Ben said that we should encourage attendees to come with colleagues as recommended by Software Carpentry. We decided to follow this recommendation and discussed on how to implement it:
- add an item in the registration form to name possible colleagues wishing to attend the workshop
- make sure we respect these wishes (especially when the workshop is full/nearly full and we have to pick up a few persons only).

Ben mentionned recurring setup problems with attendees: several did not follow the setup instructions and did not install the necessary tools. However, we only discovered it on the second day when using git. We decided to check the availability of all the necessary tools (python, git, etc.) at the beginning of a Workshop to avoid wasting time on the second day.


Lex also pointed an issue with the room booking system at the Science Library. It does not allow to book a room more than a month in advance which delays advertisement of Software Carpentry workshops and as a consequence the registration process. No specific action was taken to circumvent this problem. 

###Software Carpentry Workshop in February###

The next Software Carpentry workshop will be held on the 1st and 2nd of February 2016. The program will be similar to the previous workshop: Unix command line, Python and git.

Instructors:
- Unix: Halfdan & Anne
- Python: Arvind & Ben
- Git: Lex

Helpers: Katie, Hans (and possibly more if we can recruit a few more)


###Actions###
- Karin will send an email to those who are in the waiting list with a link to the registration form for the coming Software Carpentry workshop (February).
- Karin will ask Liv to add in the registration form the possibility to name colleagues (2 or 3 maximum) wishing to attend the workshop together. 
- Karin will modify the email sent to attendees to highlight the setup session (8:30 to 9:00 on the first day) and encourage attendees to come to the setup session if they do not manage to install the necessary software (or don't have time to do so), .
- Anne & Hans will choose a week (no holidays, etc.) for each potential workshop  (from April) and setup a doodle for each of them.

##March ‘Carpentry week'##
A ‘Carpentry week' is being organized in March 2016 (14-18 March 2016). Lex gave some information about the preliminary program:

- First day (starts Monday afternoon), some talks and discussions on open access and open data will take place
- Tuesday and Wednesday will be dedicated to Carpentry workshops. 3 Carpentry workshops are planned in parallel:
    - A general Software Carpentry workshop
    - A Data Carpentry Workshop on Genomics
    - A Data Carpentry Workshop on spatio-temporal data for Geoscientists 

- Thursday:
    -  Workshop on reproducibility is planned (Lead by Titus Brown and with Leah Wasser and Tracy Teal). See some info at https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/workshop-planning/blob/master/workshopOverview.md
    - Library Carpentry is planned

Titus Brown, Tracy Teal and Leah Wasser will be coming. Titus Brown for the reproducibility workshop, Tracy Teal & Titus Brown for the Data Carpentry workshop on Genomics and Leah Wasser for the Data Carpentry on spatio-temporal data.

We discussed on the difficulty to run 3 workshops in parallel and whether we have enough instructors: Arvind and Halfdan were clearly interested to be instructors for the Software Carpentry workshop and suggested to have unix, python and git.
Marius will be a helper.

Lex said that it should not be a problem to hire an external instructor for this event if needed.

-    Birthday Library, Skills for open sciences. 
-    SC, 2 DC: genomics (Tracy Teal, Titus ) and (Leah Wasser, NEON),   
-    Workshops on reproducibility sciences (Titus, Tracy, Leah) and a Library Workshop. Helper: Michel, John, etc.
SC (unix, python, git): check with Huges (Arvind, Hugues, Al, ). See if we need an external instructors. Help (Hannah, Marius)


###Actions###
- Arvind will check if Hugues is available for running the Software Carpentry in March
- Arvind will ask Hannah is she wants to be a helper.

##Recruiting helpers and instructors##

As pointed out in the first section (2015 summary), it is important to be able to recruit new helpers and allow them to become instructors.

Send email to those who attended workshops to recruit helpers.

###Actions###
- Karin will send an email to the registration list.
- Newcomers (Hans, Katie, Michel Heeremans, John Burkhart,  etc.) wishing to participate in UIO Software Carpentry activities should send an email to Karin (Karin.Lagesen@medisin.uio.no). She will add them to all our UIO carpentry mailing lists.

##Beyond the workshop##

We discussed possible follow-up to Software Carpentry Workshops and how to build a community of users at the University. We decided to set-up regular meetings "Therapy meeting" on Fridays and to make it attractive we suggested to have:

-  1/2 hour presentation/demo on a chosen subject (Unix Permissions, Open sciences, Make lessons, unit testing lessons, github branching)
-  1/2 to 1 hour with more open discussions; attendees could come with their laptops and data and show what they have done or try to do. 
 

We also discussed on how to better advertise our action at the University of Oslo. Several ideas were mentioned:

- Writing a short article on Software Carpentry at UIO to be published in Uniforum and/or Apollon
- Having a short summary on the front page of the UIO website

Ben also mentioned binder (http://mybinder.org) as a simple way to turn a GitHub repository into interactive notebooks. Jupyterhub (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub) has been mentionned too (the Department of Geosciences has set-up an educational portal using jupyterhub; it has been requested and used by John Burkhart).

###Actions###
- Lex will find a time and a room (lobby sciences library would be OK) for our Friday follow-up meetings. He will make a program for the first meetings: subjects will be taken from our discussion today but send an email to Lex if you wish to discuss a subject we haven't mentioned today.
- Karin and Lex are in charge of contacting Apollo and uniforum to publish a short article on Software Carpentry activities at UIO.
